# Batemanater
Batemanater mating system variable estimation tool.

The Batemanater program, Batemanater1_3.exe, is compiled to run on any modern version of Windows.

The folder, BatemanaterV1_3Source, contains the source files, which will compile only with
Codegear RAD Studio's C++ Builder 2007.  However, most of the subroutines are in native C++, which
could be useful to anyone trying to write new programs based on Batemanater.

The manual describes how to run Batemanater and the types of problems it's designed to address.

Sample_Mating_System.cpp contains the source code for a simple program that simulates mating systems
and samples from simulated mating systems.  It is described in more detail in its own readme file.
